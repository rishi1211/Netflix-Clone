# Netflix-Clone
This project was bootstrapped using Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can execute the following commands:

npm start
Launches the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.
The app automatically reloads when you make edits.
Any lint errors will appear in the console.
npm test
Runs the test suite in interactive watch mode.
Refer to the Testing documentation for more details.
npm run build
Builds the app for production and outputs it to the build folder.
Bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for maximum performance.
The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.
Ready for deployment! Refer to the Deployment documentation for more details.
npm run eject
Important: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot revert.
Use this if you're unsatisfied with the default build tools and configurations.
Ejecting copies all configurations and dependencies (e.g., Webpack, Babel, ESLint) into your project, giving you full control.
After ejecting, all commands except eject will still work but will point to the copied configurations.
Recommendation: Avoid ejecting unless customization is absolutely necessary.
