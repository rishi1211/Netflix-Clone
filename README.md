## Getting Started with Create React App  

This guide provides a structured overview of the features and scripts available in a project initialized with #### **'Create React App'**, designed to simplify React development and deployment.

---

### **Available Scripts**  

Within the project directory, you can execute the following commands:  

#### **`npm start`**  
- Launches the application in **development mode**.  
- Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.  
- The application automatically reloads upon saving edits, and any linting errors will be displayed in the console.  

#### **`npm test`**  
- Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
- Refer to the [Testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for detailed instructions on running tests.  

#### **`npm run build`**  
- Creates a **production-ready build** of your application in the `build` folder.  
- Optimizes the build for performance by minifying files and including hashed filenames.  
- Your application is ready to deploy; see the [Deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for further guidance.  

#### **`npm run eject`**  
- **Note:** This is a one-way operation and cannot be reversed.  
- Ejecting allows full control over the build tools and configurations, such as Webpack, Babel, and ESLint.  
- It is recommended to use this command only if customization is required beyond the default setup.
